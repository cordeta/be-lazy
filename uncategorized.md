## Making movies

We would like to generate a movie out of a (maybe very long) list of png images. We first create a file containing the list of png files sorted according to the order with which they should appear in the movie. If the names of the files are `img-1.png`, `img-2.png`, *etc.*, this can be accomplished by typing

```
$ ls -1v img-*.png > list.dat
```

The `-v` option is a GNU extension that tells `ls` to order entries according to the natural sorting of the numbers contained in the entry names. If on your system this option is not supported or it does something else (this might be the case on BSD/OSX systems), then you can use the following command

```
$ ls -1 img-*.png | sort -n -t'-' -k 2 > list.dat
```

`-n` applies natural sorting, `-t'-'` tells sort to use dashes as the separators to split the entries it acts on into fields and `-k 2`  to sort according to the value of the second field

A movie of width WIDTH, height HEIGHT and framerate FPS can now be generated by using `mencoder` with the following options:

```
$ mencoder mf://@list.dat -mf w=WIDTH:h=HEIGHT:fps=FPS:type=png -ovc xvid -xvidencopts bitrate=200 -o output.avi
```

The `-ovc xvid` controls the type of output and may not be suitable on all systems (or for all the purposes). The `-xvidencopts bitrate=200` option sets a sort of *overall* quality of the output.

## Adding a fading, rounded border to figures with GIMP

1. Select the whole picture (`ctrl + a`)
2. Shrink the border by an appropriate amount of pixels (Select &rarr; Shrink). I would say no more than 10% of the figure size.
3. Round the selection (Select &rarr; Rounded Rectangle)
4. Invert the selection (`ctrl + i`)
5. Feather the border (Select &rarr; Feather). I usually choose a number similar to the one used in step 2.
6. Delete the selected region (press delete)
7. Turn white into alpha (Colours &rarr; Colour to Alpha)
8. Create a new layer (same width and height as the figure) and put it underneath all other layers
9. Fill the layer with the background colour you want your picture to fade to at the border (usually black)
